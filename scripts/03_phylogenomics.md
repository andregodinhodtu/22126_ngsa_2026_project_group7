# Pipeline carried to perform phylogenomics analysis 

Analysis of the ITS Region Following the Original Study

## 1. Local alignment and trimming of fasta files - Script_01

Local alignment of FASTA sequences were performed using the CLUSTAL W algorithm implemented in the msa R package (version 1.42.0). The resulting alignments were visually inspected in MEGA (version 12), and sequences were trimmed between positions 162 and 384, yielding the same alignment length as reported in the original study (224 bp).

## 2. Best-fitting nucleotide substituiton model

In the original study, the optimal nucleotide substitution model for the ITS region was determined using jModelTest, which identified the Hasegawa–Kishino–Yano model with a gamma distribution and equal rate weights (HKY+G). Model selection performed with the phangorn R package (version 2.12.1) supported the same model.

## 3. Running BEAUTi

Analyses were conducted in BEAUTi (version 10.5.0) using a strict molecular clock and the Hasegawa–Kishino–Yano substitution model with a gamma distribution and equal rate weights (HKY+G). A Yule process was specified as the tree prior. The Markov chain was run for 25,000,000 generations, with parameters sampled every 1,000 generations.

## 4. Running BEAST

BEAST (version 10.5.0) was used for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. The BEAGLE library (version 4.0.0) was installed to optimize computational performance during likelihood calculations.

## 5. Tracer to confirm convergence

Convergence diagnostics were intended to be performed using Tracer. However, compatibility issues arose due to the requirement for an older Java version. To address this, a custom script was developed to evaluate parameter convergence.

## 6. TreeAnnotator to build the tree

TreeAnnotator (version 10.5.0) was used to summarize the sampled trees and generate the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. A 10% burn-in (2500 trees) was applied to exclude the initial portion of the MCMC samples prior to summarization, ensuring only post-convergence trees were included in the final analysis.

## 7. Visualization of the tree -  Script_02

The resulting maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was visualized in R using the output file generated by TreeAnnotator. Visualization and annotation were carried out with the treeio, ggtree, ape, and tidyverse packages, enabling detailed inspection of tree topology and clade support.
